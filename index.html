        <p> Hello everyone! I am glad you are here to view my webpage.<br>
            I just started learning HTML for web design. My goals are to learn CSS and JavaScript as well<br>
            I currently take CSC 106 and I believe I will become an excellent website creator<br>
            With the help of professor and his TA's I have all the resources needed. </p>
