        <h2>Welcome to my About Me Page!</h2>
        <p> Hello! My name is Aditya Kini. I am a senior at the University of Rhode Island <br>
            majoring in Finance. I took computer science because it has always been a subject<br>
            I have been interested in. Also, the course is important for my major. Computer <br>
            science is a great subject in general no matter what major someone is.<br>
            At the young age of 10 years old I have had a love for computers. It started off <br>
            with video games. I built my first computer at 13 years old and found the skill <br>
            to be incredibley useful. I can now build great computer for a cheaper cost.<br> </p>
